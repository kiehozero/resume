Welcome to my resume mini-project. Built using the Code Institute student template for Gitpod, I've followed the course instructional videos to create a basic resume that combined my previous work experience with my overall course experience. As the course continues I'll update my progress as well as include a gallery and links to some of my Gitpod projects.

## To do

[ ] I've yet to add in a list of courses I'm currently subscribed to on CodeAcademy, FutureLearn and Udemy.

[ ] I've not firmed up the colour scheme I'd like the overall website to have. I'll stick to four colours, but there' quite a bit of Bootstrap overriding and class additions that I'll need to do.

[ ] I'm toying with the idea of changing the progress bar colour scheme to match those of the official programming language logos.

[ ] My name and role description need centring when they display on a mobile device.

[ ] I'm going to personalise the content on the Interests pages from the initial tutorial content.

[x] Hide the Contact Info box when contact.html displays on a mobile device.
